Shadow-99 is a MUD server and library that I started working on in 1999.

This server is very bare-bones! It do have movement and some communications
commands implemented, as well as a (pretty complete) parser for the world
files. All the rest, like skills, spells, magic, fighting and almost every-
thing else you expect from a MUD server still needs to be implemented.

There is one administrative player, name "admin" with password "admin1".
Change this password before putting up the MUD for public!
