Character Generation
--------------------
The first thing a user does, after confirming his name, is to select gender.
Then the character attributes, abilities and appearance is rolled.  This
rolling phase can be redone until the player is satisfied.  Players do not
pick a class until they are in the game, when they must find the guild of
the class they want to be, and join the guild.  Of course, players can choose
to not join a guild, and train their abilities and attributes themselves.

Abilities rolled includes things such as:
  agility (depends on dexterity)
  reading (depends on intelligence)
  writing (depends on intelligence)
  spell casting

Other things rolled on character creation:
  wealth
  appearance
  age

When a character is created, it is equipped with some (random) equipment,
and are given a random amount of money.  The age of the character is rolled
between 15 and 19.  For characters with high spell-casting ability, will get
low knowledge in one or more random spells.  See the following table for how
the spells are distributed.

Spell-casting | # spells | Spell level
-------------+----------+------------
    100      |     5    |     10%
     90      |     4    |      8%
     80      |     3    |      6%

All classes have different guilds.
The priest guild is, of course, in the temple.  The Warrior Guild is in the
castle.  The Rangers guild is outside the city walls, so is the Druids guild.
The Wizards have their guild in their part of the University.  The Thiefs
guild is at a secret place.

    Stonehill
    ---------

==============================================================================

The city of Stonehill.

The city of Stonehill, is placed on a hill, next to an old and mystic stone
formation.  It is quite big, and is the capital of ???.  It is also the
academic and religious center in this part of the world.

At the top of the hill, and dominating the city, lies the Temple of the two
Gods, the city's oldest building.  Next to the temple lies the royal castle,
home and court of king Beregund XXVII.  The castle is quite old, around one
thousand years or so.  In the north-west corner of Stonehill, near the city-
walls, lies the University.

Trough the north-east end of Stonehill floats the Stonehill river.  At the
river is the harbor, the most important trading place in the city.  Even
though the river is not very big, it is still one of the most important trade-
routes through the continent.


==============================================================================

Mad Orwell.

It is unclear how Stonehill came into existence, but reading the Book of Ages
at the university reveals the following story.
A long time ago, a Sheppard named Orwell, had his small hut and home near to
the stones.  After not being heard of for several weeks, Orwells employer
(a farmer named Jorge Hamson) went to the hill to search for Orwell.  Jorge
found Orwell sitting in his hut, more or less as a drooling madman, holding
a book.  Orwell claimed he had solved the mystery of the stones, and that he
had written it down in the book.  Many people came to listen to Mad Orwell,
as he now was called, and after some time a small village grew up around
him, and the village soon grew into a city.  When Orwell died, on new years
day on what then became year 0, his followers buried him, and then built a
church around the grave.  Deep down in the Temple of two Gods, in what is
called Orwells Crypt, there lies a large stone-plate that is said to be
Orwells grave.  As with all tales and myths, none of this have ever been
confirmed, and the book Orwell is said to have written have never been found.

==============================================================================

The mysterious stones.

There are a total of twelve stones in the formation.  One center stone, five
stones placed in a circle around the center stone, three stones in a line to
the southwest, and three stones in a line to the northeast.  The circle is
around ten meters in diameter.  The center stone, which is also the highest,
has a sculpture of a large raven facing north at the top.  All the stones are
around three meters high, except the center stone which is five meters high.
All the stones are of some black material not found anywhere around Stonehill.
On the stones are strange carvings, runes and pictures.  Many carvings looks
like ravens.  Many people have tried to solve the mysteries of the stones, but
none have succeeded.  There does however exist a myth that a man called Mad
Orwell have succeeded to solve the mystery, but no evidence of that have ever
been found.


==============================================================================

The royal court:  [rename to something more appropriate]

King Beregund XVII, son of Agarond III, was named after Beregund Dragon
Slayer, founder of the Helokain dynasty.  To understand the court today, you
need to know how Arnold Eiskilson became Beregund 'Dragon Slayer' Helokain.
In the year 1738, a giant dragon moved into cave not to far from the city.
Not soon there after, the dragon demanded sacrifices from the city inhabitants.
King Ungold the Old sent out his knights to fight the dragon, but to no
prevail.  Finally, after twenty years of terror from the dragon, the king
marched out with an army to kill the dragon.  That failed, and the king was
killed together with the whole army.  Leaving no heir to the throne, the
nobles started to fight each other to put themselves on the throne.  Two hundred
years later, the land was torn apart by the raging armies and the fierce
dragon.  One day, the dragon burned down a farm, only leaving one survivor;
Arnold Eiskilson.  After he buried his family, he swore that he would not rest
until the dragon was dead.  So, the young Arnold set forth in the trail of the
dragon.  Not much is known about his travels, but he managed to gather a
following from all corners of the world.  There was Xiang Pieng from the far
east, the sorceress Anna Bjorkdottir from the north, Abuhla Kahnosh from the
south, and a giant quiet man from the west only known as Floating Wind.  Also
following him was a dwarf from the mines of Oskothch, a giant from Wryxtia,
and a troll from... well, only trolls can pronounce the name of that place.
After one of Arnolds travels, he came back riding on a giant night-black
horse, with no known name.  Arnold always carried on a large black sword,
and it is told that the sword was taken from a mighty wizard who had crafted
it many hundred years ago from a stone that fell from the sky.  The stories
about Arnold and his company are many, and they traveled far and wide, not
only in search of the dragon, but also helping other people to get rid of
monsters and evil wizards.  One day, after many years of travel and questing,
the party finally found the dragons cave.  They entered the cave, and did not
come out until a week later, most of them badly hurt.  It is not known what
happened to the dragon, but since they sealed the entrance and placed the
giant to guard the sealing, the dragon may still be in there alive.  It is
told that this was the place that now is called Giants seal, where a stone
formation resembling a giant man can be found.  By now, more people started
to follow Arnold and his party, until he finally had a whole army.  And
people begun to beg him to stop the age-old civil war.  And so he did, until
he had conquered all baronies and all counties.  At that point he changed
name to Beregund Helokain, and proclaimed himself as king and protector of
???.
[Story about how he found a queen?]


==============================================================================

Dragon Castle.

It is said that the first castle built in Stonehill, was only a garrison for
the temple.  In 1872 Beregund Helokain, then known by his real name Arnold
Eiskolson, moved into the garrison with his army, and said he was going to
end the civil war that has been fought for over a century.  When the war was
over, and Beregund proclaimed king (in the year 1879), he started to extend
the garrison into a castle for himself.  The castle was finished just a few
months before Beregunds death in 1923, and Beregund was buried in a crypt in
the castle chapel.  Unlike many other castles, Dragon Castle (so named after
Beregunds deeds as a dragon slayer) has not been rebuilt much since then.
The only exception to that is the Tower of Sorrow, which was started by
Beregunds great grandson Aalrik the sad in 2018.  The plans for this tower
was at the grand scale.  Over 100 meters high, and with a base over 50
meters in diameter, and all built with snow-white stones.  However, after
a fire during the building of the tower (where Aalrik lost his whole family
except one daughter) when the tower was almost finished, the tower fell.
Aalrik decided that the tower should be rebuilt using the black and sooty
stones from the old tower, as a reminder of the great loss of so many lives.
The reconstruction of the tower after the fire 2033 did only progress very
slowly, and and was not finished until 2097, a long time after Aalriks to
early death in 2039.
Not much have happened with Dragon Castle since then, but there are stories
about hidden passages and secret tunnels between the castle and both the
temple, the university, and outside the city walls.


==============================================================================

The University.

In the year 127, the Plain Emperor Julius II together with the High Priest of
the Two Gods founds the University.  Although the University is independent
of the church, its primary goal is to serve as an educational resort for the
priest hood.  The University is the first place for higher education in all the
known world, and the university of Arkham wasn't founded until the year 201.
Today the University has grown into a small city in the city, and it occupies
nearly one fifth of the size of Stonehill.


==============================================================================

The Temple of two Gods and Religion.

The myth says that a man now called Mad Orwell deciphered the mysterious
stones outside Stonehill.  When he died, his followers built a small temple
around his grave.  During the years new buildings was added to the temple,
until 1453, when it got the look it still got today.  All this rebuilding and
reconstruction, has of course turned the temple into a giant maze of corridors
and hallways.  There even exists parts that no man has been in for several
centuries.  Many attempts to map the temple have failed, and some of the
map makers have even  disappeared among the many cellars and towers.

Deep inside the temple lies the so called Orwells crypt, where it is said
Mad Orwell is buried.  This also the place where 'The Book of the Gods' is
kept.  This book is a copy of the book Orwell wrote down his deciphering of
the large stones and its runes.  Of course, the current book not a direct copy
of the original book, but rather a copy of a copy of... well, you get it?
This copy is believed to have been written the 12'th or 13'th century.  There
are tales that the original book is still lying somewhere in the temple, but
no one have ever found it.

So what does 'The Book of the Gods' say?  It states that in the beginning
there was two gods.  One brother, Alrung, and one sister, Sheelai.  After
creating the world and all its creatures, including man, the two gods came
into a fight on how to rule the world the created.  During this age long
fight, their grudge against each other got a dark life on its own.  This new
and evil creature started to turn man against man, and animal against animal.
Finally it became so strong that it cracked the earth in two halves.  After it
successfully cracked the world, it cried out a challenge to Alrung and
Sheelai, and called itself Inglima, the earth cracker.  When Alrung and Sheelai
heard the challenge and saw what had happened to the world, they decided to
bury their grudge, literary.  They put the world back together, placing
Inglima in the center, and sealed the world with a ring of magic stones.
The stones outside Stonehill was the last part of the seal laid, and it's
the place they decided that the should leave the world so it wouldn't be in
the way if the started to fight again.  The also decided to watch over the
world, and promised to return if the creature Inglima should get loose again.
To be able to watch over the world, Alrung took his left eye and placed it in
the sky, where it started to burn with an intense heat and light.  And Sheelai
took her right eye and placed it in the sky where it froze colder than ice.
They also created the ravens to watch over the humans and animals, and hold
after the evil and dark creatures created by Inglima.
Inglima has tried many times to escape from its prison in the center of the
earth, resulting in earthquakes and volcanos.
The book also says that the stones outside Stonehill is the last part of the
seal remaining intact, and when they are destroyed Inglima is set free to once
again spread chaos around the land, until Alrung and Sheelai returns to once
more imprison Inglima.

Stonehill has been the religious capital of the western world since the
year 89.  Soon the priest hood had grown so strong that neither Shalua Shacun
nor Ziang Tsipau could close the Temple of Two Gods.  However, in 817 under
the dictatorship of Eizo Shin in the so called bloody week, almost the whole
priest hood is killed and the temple is closed.  This marks the beginning of
the end of Eizo Shins days as king, and in 818 he is hanged by a raging
crowd outside the reopened temple.  In 938, when raiding barbarian parties
from the north is pretty usual, the high priest of the Two Gods decides to
send missionaries to the northern countries.  The first years, many
missionaries was killed, but since Arn Folkesson, leader of one of the larger
tribes, converted in 952 more and more tribes convert to the Two Gods.
In 998,  after the invasion of Karl Sveningsson, Stonehill is declared
official religious capital of the northern tribes.


==============================================================================

The geography.

Stonehill is placed in the southeast corner of ???, next to the Stonehill
river.  The stonehill river is the continents longest river, stretching from
the Eagle mountain at the border of the desert in the south, and flows to the
Dark Sea ocean in the north.  At the Eagle mountain also start the Green 
forest, a light forest that follows the river almost to Stonehill.  At the
southwest border lies the Shadow Gorge, a giant crack in the ground shaped
like a crescent moon.  Northwest lies the Large plains, a sea of grass
stretching from the ocean in the north to the Dark Woods in the south.  These
plains are also the home of the Plain Empire.  The Dark woods lies as a
borderline between the Shadow Gorge and the Large plains.  To the west of
Stonehill lies a fertile hilly plain.  Following this plain is the west trade
route that leads at least as far east as to the eastern empire.

Along the west trade route to the east lies Hollow Mountains, home of the
dwarves.  At the north end of the mountain-chain lies the White Mountain
massive, the last known place where trolls and giants still live.  The chain
ends at the south with Eagle Mountain.  Eagle Mountain also marks the northern
end of the Sand Sea desert.  The trade route continues west to the western
border of the Plain Empire, passing both Stonehill and Arkham, capital of the
Plain Empire.

and has no son or daughter to take over the throne.  The Plain Empire itself
is also weak, for the first time this millennium.  This of course means that
the land once more is threatened with civil war between nobles.  Rumors say
that old dark and evil creatures are staring to appear.  There are also
rumors about
