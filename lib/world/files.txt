The directory structure is as follows:

.
|-- <area #1>
|   |-- <area file>.are
|   |-- <zone #1>
|   |   |-- <zone file>.zon
|   |   |-- <all locations>.loc
|   |   |-- <all items>.itm
|   |   |-- <all monsters>.mon
|   |   |-- <all shops>.shp
|   |-- <zone #2>
|   `-- <zone #3>
|-- <area #2>
|-- <area #3>
|-- .
|-- .
|-- .
`-- <area #n>


This structure is not standardised or enforced.  It's just tailored to my own
specific taste.
